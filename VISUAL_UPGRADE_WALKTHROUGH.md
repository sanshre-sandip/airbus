# Walkthrough - Visual Upgrade & Mobile Responsiveness

I have significantly upgraded the visual design to a "high graphics" standard and implemented full mobile responsiveness.

## Changes Made

### 1. High-End Visuals (`assets/css/main.css`)
- **Animated Backgrounds**: Added floating gradient orbs that move smoothly in the background, creating a dynamic, living feel.
- **Premium Typography**: Switched to the 'Outfit' font family for a modern, clean look.
- **Refined Glassmorphism**: Enhanced the glass cards with better blur, subtle borders, and hover lift effects.
- **Neon Accents**: Added glowing neon effects to active elements and hover states.
- **Custom Scrollbar**: Styled the scrollbar to match the theme.

### 2. Mobile Navigation (`nav.php`)
- **Hamburger Menu**: Added a hamburger icon visible only on mobile devices.
- **Slide-Down Drawer**: Implemented a smooth slide-down menu for mobile users to access all links.
- **Responsive Layout**: The navbar now adapts perfectly to mobile screens, hiding desktop links and showing the mobile toggle.

## Verification
- **Visuals**: The site now features a deep, dark theme with vibrant, moving gradients.
- **Mobile**: Clicking the hamburger menu on a small screen correctly toggles the navigation drawer.
- **Responsiveness**: Cards and grids collapse appropriately on smaller screens.

## Next Steps
- The site is now fully responsive and visually premium. No further immediate actions are required.
